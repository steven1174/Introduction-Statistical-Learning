# An Introduction to Statistical Learning

This repository is based on the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

The book aims to explain the set of tools for understanding and modeling complex datasets. It implements some of the most standard statistical learning methods using the software package R. I tried to replicate many of the examples developed in the book using Python instead of R, in order to practice the concepts, and to study.
